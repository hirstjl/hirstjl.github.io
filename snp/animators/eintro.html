<H1>A Graphical Tool for Linear Algebra</H1>

The procedure eshow graphically illustrates some concepts from introductory
linear algebra.  When passed a 2x2 matrix A as an argument, the procedure computes
the product Au for each of several unit vectors u, and displays the results as
an animation.  Additionally, each frame contains textual annotations including
decimal approximations of u, |u|, Au, and |Au|.

<P>
You can view a <A HREF="eshowa.gif">demonstration animation</A> generated
by eshow using your browser.  (To create new animations for matrices of your
choice, you will need access to Maple.)

<H2>
To use eshow, follow these steps...
</H2>
<UL>
If you have installed Maple V Release 4 as a helper application on your browser, you can
load the <A HREF="eshow.mws">eshow worksheet</A>.
<P>
Otherwise, following these instructions:

<UL>
<LI>  Cut the Maple commands from the <A HREF="ecode.html">Maple for eshow</A>
page and paste it into a Maple V Release 4 worksheet.  Press enter.
<LI>  Enter a matrix.  For example, use the command
A:= matrix([[2,0],[1,1]]);  Press enter.
<LI>  Enter the command eshow(A);  Press enter, and watch your animation.
