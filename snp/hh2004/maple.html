<h3>To view level curves in Maple:</h3>

<OL>
<LI>  Execute a plot command like:
<tt>plot3d(x^2+y^2,x=-2..2,y=-2..2,color=x^2+y^2,scaling=constrained,style=patchcontour,axes=boxed);</TT>
</LI>
<LI>  Click on the plot and rotate 135 degrees right (about z-axis) and
45 degrees down (about x-axis) to get a top view.
</LI>
</OL>

<H3> Comments: </H3>
<UL>
<LI>  The coloring, scaling, style and axes may be omitted from the plot
command and selected from menus that appear when the graphic is selected.
</LI>
<LI>
Exact z values for the level curves can be indicated by using the contour
option. For example, include <tt>contour = [0,1,2]</tt> in the plot command to
restrict level curves to z=0, z=1, and z=2.
</LI>
<LI>
Because Mathematica does not allow live manipulation of graphic objects,
it is not suitable for this demonstration.
</LI>
<LI>
The rotations can be automated via an
