<H2>Technical Notes:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>  Maple V release 4 is required to run eshow.
<LI>  To modify the code for release 3, the "arrow"
commands can be replaced with line segments.
<LI>  The Maple code for eshow presented in MapleTech
and the ICTCM electronic proceedings contains an
error which results in incorrect calculations of the
length of Au.  The code presented here has been corrected.
<LI>  Animations can be generated more quickly
by reducing the number of frames.
<LI>  The display(seq(display...)) structure of the
procedure preserves color assignments in the animation.
(The animate command loses the color information.)
</UL>

<H2>Pedagogy:</H2>

Besides the obvious uses of graphically
identifying eigenvectors and approximating
eigenvalues, eshow can be used for a variety
of linear algebra projects.  For example...
<UL>
<LI>Find numerical estimates for the basis elements of the nullspace of a matrix A.
<LI> How do the animations for invertible and singular matrices differ?
<LI>
Find three matrices, one with two distinct real eigenvalues, one with one repeated real eigenvalue, and one with no real eigenvalues; describe the displays of these matrices.
<LI>Compare the animations for rotation matrices with those of other non-singular matrices.
<LI>Describe the range space shown by a singular matrix.
</UL>
