<B>Abstract:</B>
Due to the influence of the reform movement, 
many universities use technology in their pre-calculus 
and calculus courses.  Extending the use of computer 
algebra systems into higher level undergraduate courses 
in pure mathematics enables us to capitalize on the 
skills students are learning in their introductory courses.  
Shown below are some ways to integrate the use of 
technology into courses in 
<A HREF="alg.html">abstract algebra</A>,
<A HREF="lin.html">advanced linear algebra</A>,
and <A HREF="analysis.html">analysis</A>.
In general, computer 
algebra systems are useful in creating concrete examples 
illustrating abstract concepts, and as an environment for 
experimentation leading to conjectures.
