<H1>Generating the Involute of a Circle</H1>

This page discusses Maple code that generates
two animations.  One is an animation of string unwinding
from a circle.  The second is an animation of the string, including
the path traced by the end of the string.  The added curve in
the second animation is called the involute of the circle.
