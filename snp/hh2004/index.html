<P>
Level curves have long been a standard topic in both traditional and reform 
presentations of multivariate calculus.  In some reform texts, level curve 
representations of functions are receiving increased emphasis.  Thanks to 
technology, we can lift our illustrations of level curves from the page and 
present them in 3-space, where their meaning and import is more obvious.
The simple act of rotating a 3 dimensional Maple plot with contour 
lines can teach a student more about level curves than countless flat diagrams.
