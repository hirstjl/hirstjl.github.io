<B>Analysis:</B>  We have written a Maple procedure that 
illustrates the mechanics of delta-epsilon proofs.  Students enter:
<UL>
<LI>  a function (f) 
<LI>  a point in the domain (a)
<LI>  an expected limit (L), and
<LI>  maximum values for epsilon and delta.
</UL>
The procedure generates an animation where each frame 
corresponds to a value of e between 0 and the given 
maximum.  Here are two frames from the animation 
for f=x^2 with a=1 and L=1:
<br><br>
<CENTER>
The first frame corresponds to an epsilon value of .3125

<br><br>
<CENTER>
The second frame corresponds to an epsilon value of .75
</CENTER>

Students can apply modeling skills to 
find a function that lies below the 
minimum (red) graph on the right.  This yields 
the desired expression for delta in terms of epsilon.
(Please refer to our paper on
<I>Incorporating Modeling into Undergraduate 
Courses,</I>
in the proceedings of the ICTM at Samos.)

We are currently revising the Maple code for this procedure.
When the revisions are complete, a link to the improved
code will be provided here.
