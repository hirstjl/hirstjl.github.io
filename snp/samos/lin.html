The Maple command jordan(A) calculates the 
Jordan canonical form of the matrix A.  Here are some examples:

Since A and B have different Jordan 
forms, they are not similar matrices.
We can also use the Jordan forms to 
find information about the eigenvectors and associated 
eigenspaces for these matrices.
