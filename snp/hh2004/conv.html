<h3>To convert Maple animations to Quicktime movies (with sliders)</h3>

<OL>
<LI>Enter and execute the <A HREF="anim.html">animation</A> command in Maple.
</LI>
<LI>Resize the animation window as desired.  (It's better to do this now.)
</LI>
<LI>With the animation window selected, go to the File menu and
select "Export as html."  Choose GIF output, and note where the
GIF will be saved.
</LI>
<LI>Wait.  You have time for coffee.
</LI>
<LI> Maple will export an html page displaying your animation.  The
animation is stored in animated GIF format.  Now we'll convert the
animated GIF to a Quicktime movie, so that we get that nice slider.
</LI>
<LI>Start
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">Quicktime Pro.</A>
Under the file menu, select "Open movie
in new player," and then select the GIF.  You can either "save-as"
a self-contained movie, or "export" as a movie.  If you export,
selecting options-settings-graphics will reduce the file size
substantially.
